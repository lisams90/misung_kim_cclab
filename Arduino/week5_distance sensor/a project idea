[Arduino] Turning the LED on based on the distance measured by the ultrasonic sensor 
Basically, ultrasonic frequency is higher than the audible range of sound.
I used the ultrasonic sensor(HC-SR04) which measures the distance and the speed, using a ultrasound.

Transmission: Emitting a short ultrasonic pulse at intervals
Receiver: Receiving an echo signal back which hit an object

Distance(cm) = pulseIn(ECHO_PIN, HIGH)/58;
I calculated the distance based on the time difference between the transmitter and receiver, and measured distance of the object.
Then, I made the LED turn on, when an object is detected within a certain distance (10 cm) from the ultrasonic sensors.
I also can see the distance in a serial monitor.

Materials: An ultrasonic sensor, LED, A resistor, 8 jumper cables 
*Still need to figure out which part has wrong
